1,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"Home 2 not only has an excellent location (walking distance to the Convention Center, Reading Terminal Market, China Town, Liberty Bell and South Street.) but is the BEST hotel I have stayed in with-in the city itself. Rooms are very large and clean. The beds are comfortable. I love this place!Not only is this place modern but it's super clean, quiet. Full kitchen including a dishwasher. There is a pod coffee maker with tons of pods to choose from. Excellent coffee bar in lobby and a large breakfast buffet is included.I would definitely stay here again!

2,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",1,Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More,Would NEVER Recommend!
3,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",3,"Good location, nice breakfasts. Front desk customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The staff were pleasant sometimes and indifferent to rude at other times. Never received my room upgrade either.",All good except the front desk customer service
4,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small.,Great family location
5,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

6,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"Very clean and comfortable rooms. Kitchenette included in the room. All staff was friendly and helpful. Great lobby and an excellent breakfast. Wonderful location, right across from the Philadelphia convention center and Reading Market. The Southeast Pennsylvania Regional Transit Association rail terminal and train to the airport is next to the Reading Terminal. Easy walk to Independence Mall. Lots of shopping and eating nearby.",Suite hotel in downtown Philadelphia
7,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",3,"I wish I could separate the room experience from the breakfast experience but I can't because having breakfast included was a huge part of why we chose this hotel. Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here.",Breakfast was a disaster
8,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

9,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem.

10,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay.",Clean and vey conveniently located
11,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!,Good stay
12,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,"Nice hotel with an excellent location. Large, modern rooms. Nice facilities and great internet connection. I remove one star because housekeeping service is on request only during the weekends. This is an obvious cost saving measure, but is a inconvenience for those only staying over a weekend. I hope Hilton reexamines this policy as it's really silly and no doubt... More",Remember to ask for housekeeping!

Omar and Thomas at... More,Fantastic stay
14,HSA,Philadelphia,"Home Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,"Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again.","A few issues, but overall good"

79,AFS,Cedar Rapids,Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,2,"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know.",Needs improvement

82,AFS,Cedar Rapids,Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,5,"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids.",Glad We Stayed at Cooper's Mill
